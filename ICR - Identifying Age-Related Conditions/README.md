# ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions

https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/icr-identify-age-related-conditions/overview

I participated in the ICR Kaggle competition and secured the 189th place out of 6000 participants. This repository contains the code and resources related to my submission.

## Overview

The goal of the ICR competition was to predict if a person has any of three medical conditions. Participants were tasked with creating a model trained on measurements of health characteristics to predict if the person has one or more of any of the three medical conditions (Class 1) or none of the three medical conditions (Class 0). This README provides an overview of my approach, key results, and the structure of the project.

## Results

In the ICR Kaggle competition, my model achieved a balanced logarithmic loss of 0.397. This metric is indicative of the model's ability to make accurate predictions, considering the imbalanced nature of the dataset.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Balanced Logarithmic Loss:** 0.397

Feel free to elaborate further on the significance of this metric or provide any additional insights into your model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: 
	sumite-and-ensemble-between-note-books.ipynb
- `data/`: Data used for the competition.
	train.csv - The training set.
	test.csv - The test set. Your goal is to predict the probability that a subject in this set belongs to each of the two classes.
	greeks.csv - Supplemental metadata, only available for the training set.
	sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format. See the Evaluation page for more details.
- `README.md`: The file you're currently reading.

## Usage

To reproduce the results, follow these steps:

```bash
# Example installation steps
pip install -r alisholdo.txt
