# **About**
The train set contains ~100 000 and the test contains ~45 000 survey responses from around Africa and the world.\

The objective of this challenge is to build a machine learning model to predict which individuals across Africa and around the world are most likely to be financially resilient or not.\

Starter notebooks in Python and R will be provided. These notebooks will show you how to read in the data, build a machine learning model and make a submission on Zindi.\

If, when you click to download the starter notebook it takes you to another page, ctrl-S and it will save to your downloads folder. Otherwise, you will be able to find it in the gDrive link shared in the discussion forum.\

The target for this challenge is if you were in an emergency and needed to make a payment within the next month, can you?
