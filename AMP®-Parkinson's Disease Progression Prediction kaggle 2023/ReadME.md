# [AMP®-Parkinson's Disease Progression Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/overview)
### Use protein and peptide data measurements from Parkinson's Disease patients to predict progression of the disease.
### Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. You will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson’s disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.

**Dataset Description**
The goal of this competition is to predict the course of Parkinson's disease (PD) using protein abundance data. The complete set of proteins involved in PD remains an open research question and any proteins that have predictive value are likely worth investigating further. The core of the dataset consists of protein abundance values derived from mass spectrometry readings of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples gathered from several hundred patients. Each patient contributed several samples over the course of multiple years while they also took assessments of PD severity.
